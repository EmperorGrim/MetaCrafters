## Program Explanation
* JSProofAssessment.js : In this I learnt how to create NFTs, variable holding the NFTs their metadata and how to mint NFTs.
* eth Beginner myToken : Made a simple contract written in Solidity(.sol), complied using Remix IDE.In this we create our own Token and four functions. Which tells the amount of tokens and supply, and the amount of token being minted and burned.
* Eth+Avx intermidiateMod1 : Created a simple contract to check the weather the owner is the same using the contract or not, using three error methods - require(), revert() and assert().
